## About ðŸ“š
Everyone knows or has ever played the famous game <b><i>Tic-tac-toe</i></b>. This is a different version, much simpler, cleaner and beautiful.
This game has 3 different difficulty levels incorporated, which are:
  - <b>`Easy`</b>: The machine plays its moves in random cells, so its pretty easy to win.
  - <b>`Normal`</b>: The machine makes its moves randomly inside positions that avoid you to win. If it has the opportunnity to win, it does so.
  - <b>`Impossible`</b>: The machine generates all the possible moves that it can do or you can do and it explores them all. Then, the
    AI selects the move that has the most promising future (best move).
